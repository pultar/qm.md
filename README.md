Want to get started with computational chemistry and molecular dynamics simulations? We got you covered and compile a list to instructive tutorials and valuable ressources. We focus on quantum chemistry (QC), molecular mechanics (MM), and molecular dyanmics (MD) simulations. Of course, this also includes combinations thereof like QM/MM MD.
